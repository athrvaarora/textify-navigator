## Overview

Textify Navigator is a web application that processes directories and extracts text content from code and text files. It creates a single text file containing all code with file paths, making it perfect for sharing codebases with Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

## üöÄ Features

- **Directory Processing**: Uploads and navigates through entire directory structures
- **Nested Folder Support**: Traverses and processes nested directories automatically
- **Code File Extraction**: Extracts code from various programming languages and file formats
- **Clean Output Format**: Organizes extracted text by file paths for clear context
- **Browser-Based**: Works entirely in the browser with no server dependencies
- **Large File Support**: Handles files up to 20MB in size
- **Fast Processing**: Efficiently processes even large codebases
